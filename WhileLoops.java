        // Ask a question repeatedly (or do something repeatedly): loop (while loop)

        // LOOP RULES:

        // When you program a loop, you should know that it will
        // DEFINITELY end once some condition has occurred 

        // Usually you have to increment some variable
        // so that the loop will approach the end state
        // LCV (loop control variable)

        // WAYS TO INCREMENT A VARIABLE (3.7 in textbook)

        int count = 0;
        // how to add 1?

        count = count + 1;  //adds 1 and saves the updated value (assigns) to count
        count += 1;  // compound operator (shortcut)
        count++;  //another common way to increment by 1

        // One more note: use curly braces {  } around the while loop code!

        // HERE COMES A LOOP

        int counter = 0;

        // ends when the value of counter is 5

        while(counter != 5) {
            System.out.println(counter);
            counter += 1;   // increment (get counter to 5)
        }

        // how many times does this loop run? 5 times
        // can adjust the start/end/increment values, can also use <, >, etc.


        int num = 0;
        while (num < 3) {
            System.out.println(num);
        }

        // INFINITE LOOP OF DOOM (needs an incrementor)
        // Ctrl+z to escape/break the loop in the terminal
